# Places

## Introduction

The Places app has been created as an assignment as part of the intake process of ABN Amro. The user can select from a predefined list of locations or enter a custom location manually and show it on the Wikipedia app.

## How to run the app

1. **Open places:** Open the `Places/Places.xcodeproj` in Xcode. Xcode will automatically resolve dependencies.
2. **Build and Run:** Select the target `Places` and build and run the app.

## Future Improvements

- Automatically generate mocks using a mocking framework such as Cuckoo or Mockingbird
- Use a dependency injection framework
- Adding a design system with reusable UI components
